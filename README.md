Generate plant-like structures from a few of nature's first-principles.

Assumptions:
- Plants grow in two dimensions.
- Plants bend towards the light.
- The sun is the only light source.
- Plant branches do not cause shadows.
- All cells have the same lifetime.

First, we'll represent as an L-system:
[L-system trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system)

Could be the basis of targeting recursive data structures.

This is a discrete dynamical system.

Varied dragon curve looks promising.
